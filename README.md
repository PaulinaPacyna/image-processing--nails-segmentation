# Nails segmentation using open-cv
This is an university project for Image Processing and Computer Vision course. It aims at marking nails borders given a set of photos of hands in various gestures. 

One of the restrictions specified by the teacher was not using any ML algorithms, therefore the method is not so sophisticated, based only on the open-cv library.
